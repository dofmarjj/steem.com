                        <strong>Proof of work</strong> &#8211; Miners solve a
                        complex mathematical problem. The miner that solves the
                        problem first adds the block to the blockchain. The
                        network rewards the miner for doing so.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Proof of stake</strong> &#8211; Requires
                        ownership, or stake, in the cryptocurrency. The more
                        tokens you own, the more block creation power you have.
                        Benefits: eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs,
                        runs on a tiny fraction of the power, and it requires
                        block producers to have a stake in the network.

                        relying on proof of work to find blocks, the Steem
                        network actively schedules these accounts to improve the
                        time between blocks to 3 seconds.

                        On a technical level, the two networks rely on the same
                        model of a blockchain, but are built upon different
                        technologies and codebase. Steem is based on a new
                        state-of-the-art blockchain technology called Graphene,
                        which uses &#8220;witnesses&#8221; instead of
                        &#8220;miners&#8221; to produce blocks.

                        The &#8220;delegated proof of stake&#8221; model of
                        using witnesses instead of miners allows for greater
                        efficiency in block production. With BTC, 100% of the
                        new coins that are created are allocated to block
                        producers (miners). With the Steem blockchain, only 10%
                        of the new coins are paid to block producers
                        (witnesses). The other 90% of new STEEM coins are
                        awarded to content producers, curators, and Steem Power
                        holders.

                      <p>
                        Since transacting on the Steem blockchain has zero fees,
                        bandwidth rate-limiting is employed to safeguard the
                        blockchain from spam attacks. Every action that you take
                        on the blockchain will consume a small amount of
                        bandwidth. This includes posting, commenting, voting,
                        transferring tokens, etc. Viewing content does not
                        consume bandwidth.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Every user has a limited amount of bandwidth to use each
                        week. The more transactions a user does, the less
                        bandwidth they will have left (until it recharges).
                        Users with more Steem Power will have a higher bandwidth
                        allowance.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Normally everyone&#8217;s bandwidth allowance is quite
                        high, and users are able to use the network freely
                        without any interruptions. Sometimes when the blockchain
                        becomes busy however (due to heavy use),
                        everyone&#8217;s individual allowances may go down until
                        the network becomes less busy.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        You can check how much bandwidth you currently have
                        based on the current limit at:<a
                          href="https://steemd.com/@youraccount"
                          >https://steemd.com/@youraccount</a
                        >
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If users are below their bandwidth limit, they will be
                        unable to transact with the blockchain until their
                        bandwidth recharges or their limit is raised.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you get an error that you have exceeded your
                        bandwidth allowance, it is normally best to just wait
                        and try again later (when it is less busy). Usually if
                        you wait and try again later, the transaction will
                        likely go through.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you are unable to transact for extended periods of
                        time, or you are frequently running into bandwidth
                        limits, then you will either need to reduce your usage
                        to stay within your limit, or purchase more Steem Power

                        Blockchains like Steem and Bitcoin produce new tokens
                        each time a block is produced. Unlike Bitcoin, where all
                        of the new coins go to the block producers (called
                        miners), the Steem blockchain allocates a majority of
                        the new tokens to a reward fund called the
                        &#8220;rewards pool&#8221;. The rewards pool gives users
                        tokens for participating in the platform based on the
                        value they add.

                        The Steem Whitepaper was written to describe the
                        mechanics of the token system that makes decentralized
                        content incentives and distribution possible in a way
                        that can improve web technologies across the board. It
                        is also applicable to Steemit, the first website to plug
                        into the Steem blockchain. Users who have read the Steem
                        Whitepaper will better understand how their interactions
                        with Steemit are interactions with Steem, the
                        decentralized network.

                        There is no way to recover your account if you lose your
                        password or owner key! Because your account has real
                        value, it is <strong>very important</strong> that you
                        save your master password somewhere safe where you will
                        not lose it.

                      <p>
                        It is strongly recommended that you store an offline
                        copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard
                        drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital
                        offline storage, such as an external disk or flash
                        drive, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box

                        The Steem blockchain requires a set of people to create
                        blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called delegated
                        proof of stake, or DPOS. The community elects
                        &#8216;witnesses&#8217; to act as the network&#8217;s
                        block producers and governance body. There are 20
                        full-time witnesses, producing a block every 63-second
                        round. A 21st position is shared by the backup
                        witnesses, who are scheduled proportionally to the
                        amount of stake-weighted community approval they have.
                        Witnesses are compensated with Steem Power for each
                        block they create.
